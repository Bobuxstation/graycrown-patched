# AB Coal
A simple game launcher for Steam alternative
## Why I made this
I started this project since June 30 on Saturday when the internet government (alias Kominfo) suddenly blocked Steam. As an alternative. I developed this game launcher along with a store (WIP) to have a better alternative to Steam.
## Warnings
You must obey these warning to avoid breaking while modifications or runnning.

- Never, i mean NEVER EVER change the Electron version. Changing the version to higher than v4 may cause the ENTIRE Coal to break. The common errors for changing are for example, require is not defined, etc
  
## Installation
Run with npm, by doing this command.
```npm i```
Then running via 
```npm start```
Done. ðŸ¥°
